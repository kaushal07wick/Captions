1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Make a Mario style side scroller, but with an Indian auntie as the protagonist.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,960
In an Indian building and her main attack is to throw chappals.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,600
Chappals.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,440
Use sprites from the internet.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,560
So okay, we've got the output.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,360
Auntie's revenge.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,520
These bratty kids are making noise in the corridor.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,120
Use arrow keys to jump and move.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,480
Press Z to throw chappals.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,360
There's no output.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,720
Dude, there is no output.

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,880
Where is the auntie or the building?

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,840
Where is the output?

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,560
There's no output.

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,680
I talk to Gemini like this.

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,880
I'm just like, dude, there's no output.

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,000
I literally type the word dude.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Dude, there's no output.

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,920
Where is the auntie or the building?

20
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,960
So we now have the auntie.

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,000
She looks angry.

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,440
There's an emoji on her head actually.

23
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,120
It's created a nice little sigh for me.

24
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,360
I'm just gonna throw chappals at these stupid kids.

25
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,280
How dare they sit in my building?

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,879
Simply sitting and scrolling.

27
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,640
Not even subscribing to Varun Maya.

28
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,240
Nobody would really play a game like this.

29
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,080
I think these are very, very simple, small things.

30
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,920
But I think it's useful for marketing.

31
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,560
Like if you're a brand and you have a cool idea around marketing,

32
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,480
something, some product that you're launching,

33
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,160
you should be making simple games like this.

34
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,080
We are now entering that world where we used to have

35
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,760
mini-clip games many, many years ago.

36
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,399
You can now do that as a brand for a marketing launch,

37
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,440
which I think is pretty cool.

38
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,640
You should take advantage of it.
